# Examples

This folder contains example outputs generated by the Audio Structure Intelligence engine.

Each example demonstrates how the system analyzes a full song and extracts musical structure from raw audio.

## Included files

- `analysis.json`  
  Full structured analysis including tempo, meter, sections, rhythm hierarchy, and structure fingerprint.

- `structure_timeline.png`  
  Visual timeline of labeled song sections over time.

- `density_boundaries.png`  
  Rhythmic density curve with detected structural boundaries.

- `fingerprint.json`  
  Compact structural representation used for comparison and clustering across songs.

These examples allow the project to be understood without running the code.
